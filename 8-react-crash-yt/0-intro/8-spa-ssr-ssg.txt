SPA, SSR & SSG

There are different type of applications and websites you can build using React so what we're going to be today is a SPA(or Single page application) and this is what this framework were initially created for, so basically it loads a single HTML file(index.html) in the browser and then it loads a JS bundle that includes you entire UI(your entire application basically) and this allows our interface to be very interactive and even if you go to a specific page like let's say you click on a specific link and go to /about it's not actually loading the about page on the server, the JS is loading that content for you
So, SPAs are really fast dynamic interfaces but it can have some issues when it comes to initial page load times as well as SEOs since the content comes from JS, so the solution for that is to create a server side rendered app which you can do with a framework like next.js or remix, Now this frameworks still use React, you can kind of think it as a wrapper around React and instead of everything being bundled in a JS, the initial page load will be rendered on the server, so this is good for SEOs also for the initial page load time
Now, SSR (server side rendered app) is a little more difficult to deploy because you do need a server, In a single page app you can pretty much deploy to any type of host, SSRs use something like Versel or netlify or something like that

Third option is SSG(static site generation) a static site is where the server generates a bunch of html files at built time so we have framework like Gatsby and Astro that can do this and those frameworks also use React
