What is React?
    - React is a JS library/framework for building user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and community of individual developers and companies.
    - Websites/UIs are looked at in terms of components.
    - React is currently the most popular out of the major front-end framewors.

React is actually a UI library to be specific and not a framework and the difference is that a framework is a complete solution, so angular for instance is a full-featured framework because it includes a router, an http client, state manangement library and much more and the reason that react often referred to as a framework because it operates like a one and it's in direct competition with frameworks like angular and in fact it's actually the most popular out of the major front-end frameworks which are react, vue.js, angular and swelt and it often use with other library such as react-router to create a full featured solution

Also the ecosystem of react is huge so it can be used for wide variety of applications such as single page apps, server side rendered applications and static websites.
